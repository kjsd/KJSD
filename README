ABOUT US
========
This is the K&J Software Distribution aka KJSD.

We are various C/C++ libraries which have NO ANY GOAL. However, these
libraries have a little rule for designed:

1. Keep It Simple
2. TAKING WHAT WE NEED WHEN WE NEED IT
3. Cross-Platform as possible

If you can use rich platform which like .NET, boost, C++0x, and so on,
we may have no help to you.
